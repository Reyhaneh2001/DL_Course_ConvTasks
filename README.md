# DL_Course_ConvTasks

Implementation of 2 tasks of deep learning course:

Task 1: Applying Filters to CIFAR-10 Images
This task involves loading a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset and applying custom convolutional filters to transform the images. The filtering process is implemented using TensorFlow's Conv2D layer, and the results are visualized with Matplotlib. Two different filters are applied to highlight specific patterns in the images.

Task 2: Training CNNs with Different Learning Rate Schedules
In this task, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using two different learning rate strategies: Exponential Decay and OneCycle Learning Rate Schedule. The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization, dropout, and max-pooling. The models are trained and evaluated based on validation accuracy and loss, and their performances are compared through visualization.
